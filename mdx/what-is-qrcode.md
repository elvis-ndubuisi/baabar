A Quick Response (QR) code is a [barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode) that encodes information as a series of pixels in a square-shaped grid and can be quickly read by a digital device. It is a monochromatic matrix with embedded data that is used in manufacturing industries in order to label products. Nowadays QR codes are being used for payments in UPI-based apps, some chatting apps like WhatsApp, and in the play store.

In 1994, the Japanese company Denso Wave, a Toyota subsidary, invented the first QR code. They required a better way to track vehicles and parts during the manufacturing process. Read more about QR codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code).

Many smartphones have built-in QR readers, making it simple to track products information in a supply chain.
