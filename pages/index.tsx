                  A QR code is a two dimensional barcode that stores information
                  in black and white dots (called data pixels or “QR code
                  modules”). Besides the black and white version, you can also
                  create a colored QR code. For these codes to work without
                  problems, make sure the contrast is sufficient and the result
                  is not a negative (in terms of color). To make your QR code
                  even better, you can also get a QR code with logo.
